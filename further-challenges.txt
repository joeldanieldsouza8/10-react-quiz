1.  Allow the user to select only a certain number of questions.

2.  Allow the user to filter the difficulty of questions.

3.  Upload the high score of the quiz to our fake API. 
    As app reloads re-fetch the high score and place it back in our state
    so that we don't lose that value.

4.  Store all the answers in some array instead of just the current answer
    like we do right now. And so by doing that, the user could then 
    go back and forth in time and review their answers like that.
